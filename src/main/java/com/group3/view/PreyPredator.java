        "The y axis is number of animals, and the x axis is time in years\n" +
        "The variables are set based on provided data or other studies, and include metrics\nlike i intrinsic growth rate, initial population size, consumption rate, death rate\n\n" +
        "Context:\n" + "We see that Deer are far more affected by wolf predation than the others.\nThis is expected and is based off literature we have found that illustrate that wolves\nhave a preference for deer in the wild when faced with predation choice, and\nthe predation rate value is based off empirical data from wildlife reserves");
